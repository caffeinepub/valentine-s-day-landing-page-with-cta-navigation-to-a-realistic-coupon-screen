  "summary": "Diff adds a static HTML entry point for the /coupon route and replaces the Motoko backend actor with an empty actor. There is no evidence in the provided diff summary of changes that explicitly promote a draft deployment to live/production, and the backend change appears unrelated to the stated goals and violates the stated constraint to respect the existing backend architecture.",

      "id": "REQ-14",
      "requirement": "Identify and fix the deployment/build error preventing successful deploy; ensure clean build/deploy and both '/' and '/coupon' routes render.",
      "reason": "The diff summary does not provide direct evidence that the deployment/build error was identified and fixed end-to-end (e.g., config/build pipeline/deploy settings). It also shows backend/main.mo reduced to an empty actor, which could break existing functionality rather than fix deployment. While adding frontend/public/coupon/index.html may help /coupon refresh routing, that alone does not demonstrate a clean build + successful IC deploy + runtime correctness.",

      "reason": "The BuildRequest focuses on fixing a deployment/build error and promoting a draft to live while respecting the existing single-actor Motoko backend architecture. Replacing backend/main.mo with `actor {};` is not requested and appears to be an unrelated/destructive change rather than a targeted deployment fix.",
